# CHIP8dotNET
A C# .NET CHIP8 Emulator

This emulator was written in order to gain experience writing emulators. This version does not support graphical output, but instead contains an edited public domain dissasembler, which is useful when debugging CHIP8 assembly programs. This was my first emulator, written in less than a day. There will be bugs.
